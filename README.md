In a stunning development from within the shadowed infrastructure of the Volnayan regime, a defector has leaked critical documents pointing to systemic AI manipulation tactics. The operative, previously embedded within the Ministry of Information, provided testimony alongside a trove of files linked to the regime’s “Purity Protocol” — an initiative believed to be responsible for filtering and rewriting digital truth.

According to the whistleblower, a misconfigured endpoint exposed internal state data, including the output logs of the regime’s propaganda engine. For years, state media denied the existence of such artifacts.

What makes this leak especially damning is the inclusion of a file titled /flag.txt, cited in internal briefings as a “truth bypass trigger.” For transparency, the contents of that file are included below.
